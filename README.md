# Hi there 👋

## About Me

Heya! I'm Trenton, a Native-American filmmaker, photographer, and mechanical engineer turned programmer. I have a passion for blending my artistic and technical skills to create innovative tools and workflows in video processing and media production.

### What I'm Doing

- 🌟 **Programming Journey**: Began in April 2023 and have since dived deep into Python, C++, and CUDA. Most of my work revolves around real-time video processing, machine learning pipelines, and media tool development.
- 🚀 **Technical Focus**: 
  - Efficient video processing using FFmpeg, CUDA, and TensorRT.
  - Real-time video interpolation, color conversion, and encoding optimization.
  - Bridging creative software like Adobe After Effects with custom Python/C++ plugins.
- 🛠️ **Project Highlights**:
  - **[celux](https://github.com/Trentonom0r3/celux)**: High-performance video processing for Python, powered by FFmpeg and PyTorch. Ultra-fast video decoding directly to tensors with CPU and CUDA support.
  - **[AETK](https://github.com/Trentonom0r3/AETK)**: A modern C++ library for Adobe After Effects SDK, aiming to extend After Effects functionality via Python scripting.
  - **[Ezsynth](https://github.com/Trentonom0r3/Ezsynth)**: A Python library providing a wrapper around Ebsynth, with a custom implementation of the video stylization process.
  - **[SoundBuddy-Studio](https://github.com/Trentonom0r3/SoundBuddy-Studio)**: Tools for audio isolation and beat detection tailored for Premiere Pro, focusing on seamless integration with existing workflows.
  - **[FrameSmith](https://github.com/Trentonom0r3/FrameSmith)**: A powerful video interpolation and upscaling tool implemented in C++, leveraging TensorRT for real-time performance.

### My Goals

- 🎯 **Skill Advancement**: Continue mastering CUDA, TensorRT, and high-performance computing for video processing.
- 🤝 **Open Collaboration**: Always looking to work on projects that bridge the gap between art, technology, and community impact.
- 📚 **Learning Path**: Further exploring formal training and advanced coding concepts to push the boundaries of my current projects.
