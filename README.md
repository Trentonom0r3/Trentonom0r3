## About Me

Hiya! I'm Trenton, a 27-year-old Native-American Filmmaker and Photographer with a knack for programming. By trade, I delve into the realms of film and photography, and by education, I am a Mechanical Engineer.

### What I'm Doing

- 🌟 **Programming Journey**: Began in April 2023, fueling a non-stop exploration into coding.
- 🎨 **Creative Problem Solving**: Leveraging my artistic skills and engineering mindset to develop innovative workflows.
- 📚 **Learning Curve**: Amateur in Python, JavaScript, and getting my hands dirty with C/C++.
- 💡 **Art Meets Code**: Transforming creative visions into tangible projects through coding. Check out my projects
